Euchre Server Changes File

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

version 0.1

  February 24, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - Initial Makefile and include file implementation
   - added debug() macro

  February 26, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - reorganized include files
   - initialization routines

  February 27, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - completed config file read routines

  February 28, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - completed switch processing
   - munged around with the log stuff, got it to where it logs
     stuff by default to the file, but will use stderr if the
     file cannot be opened, and will use stderr in addition to
     the file is debugging is turned on
   - I do believe we're ready for some euchre type stuff!

  May 4, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - modified make file to also turn tags into tags.vim, to allow
     syntax highlighting for internal functions

  May 6, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - changed make file to automate generation of prototypes (this
     only works for my coding style)
   - created makescripts directory for tags2html and mkproto scripts
   - fixed SOURCE and SRC variable misnaming in Makefile
   - added distclean as a target: realclean, but also deletes
     the vim swap files (even if edit session still active)
   - tightened up the lomem() routine
   - rewrote parts of the Implementation document
   - the server will be single game only, although the protocol will
     be sufficient for a server running multiple games

  May 7, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added game and player structure, along with initialization and
     printing routines for both

  May 8, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - nicely streamlined the configuration section
   - added a Usage() routine, and hooked it up to the getopt routine.
   - fixed option processing for debug: could be turned on or off in
     config file, but only turned on via command line
   - fixed ordering in Exit() routine
   - fixed server socket open

  May 9, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - started the PlayGame() routine, which calls the DoSelect: the 
     server can now detect incoming clients
   - woo hoo, the server accepts new clients, up to a maximum of four
     and then starts to decline them: gotta snag the IP

  May 10, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added the IP detection routines
   - added a fflush() to the log file
   - added signal handling routines for SIGHUP and SIGINT
   - starting the first client

  May 11, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added a comment field to the player structure, for players to use
     to describe themselves: "Whup-Ass Beverage Service"
   - on more thought, added several new items: pstate, which can be one
     of unconnected, connected, or joined (see Implementation), msgwait,
     a boolean which is set true whenever the server is waiting for a
     response from the client, msgtime, the time when the request was
     sent to the client
   - added a pollinterval value: this is the maximum time we wait in the
     select() function before coming up to do other processing
   - next: add client timeout

  May 12, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - the client timeout works, but the message being sent isn't correct:
     how to pack an int at the start of string?
   - memcpy.  kuh

  May 13, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - reorganized some of the code: socket.c is for code that directly
     manipulates sockets, message.c is for code that directly composes
     and sends messages, client.c is the per client manipulation routines,
     and game.c runs the game: game calls client calls message calls socket
   - time to hookup a client

  May 18, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - Added code to accept and process client requests

  May 19, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - fixed select filedescriptors
   - reorganized client request code
   - separated client removal
   - tweaked mkproto
   - added JOIN, JOINDENY and JOINACCEPT routine

  May 21, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - created msgc2pl script and modified makefile to generate perl version
 
  May 27, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added the SEND debug message
   - hmmm, I'm going to have to think how ints should be represented:
     shouldn't be too awkward to send them in network byte order, I
     hope

  May 31, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added a PackInt() and PackString() routine, to massage data before
     dumping it on the net: cleans up the message preparation routines
     nicely
   - added client socket close()es to the Exit() routine
   - added a PrintBuffer() routine
   - changed scratch1[] to tbuffer1[] (etc.), and introduced char *dbuffer[]
   - message sending works, woo hoo!

 June 1, 1999
 Denis McLaughlin
  - fixed the max macro to (ahem) return the correct value
  - tweaked the maxfd stuff: multiple clients can properly connect and join

 June 5, 1999
 Denis McLaughlin
  - all network bytes being read are also byte order munged
  - added log message when client joins
  - duplicate join detection added: ignored for the moment
  - server removes disconnected clients, detected via select() and
    via write() (EPIPE, since we ignore SIGPIPE)
  - server sends a SERVERQUIT to all connected clients at time of exit
  - server can process a CLIENTQUIT

  June 6, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added ReadInt() and ReadString()
   - added processing of ID message

  June 13, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - fixed bug in ClientQuit()
   - any time a string is longer than maxmsglen, kill the client
   - server can now receive and rebroadcast a chat message

  June 14, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - wrote up initial spec for STATE message from server

  June 15, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - all strings transmitted as part of the protocol are immediately
     preceded by an integer representing their length; clients cannot
     assume they will be null terminated
   - shit, rewrite the ID message to conform to the above
   - oops, my mistake, it already works
   - further tweaking of the state message, until I spilled a glass
     of water

  June 27, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added the suits.h file
   - create Card structure
   - completed PackCards() and PackCard()
   - tweaked Makefile to generate suits.pl file
   - split the packing routines into pack.c
   - reformatted the JOIN message to include user name (so that we can
     announce the player to existing players
   - fixed bug with ID broadcasts
   - fixed bug with unexpected disconnect logging

  June 29, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - changed all outgoing messages to be preceded by message lengths,
     even if the only data is a string (with its own length)
   - accomodated client message changes from <gh> <ph> <msglen> to
     <msglen> <gh> <ph>


  July 6, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - changed message format to have the <msglen> as the first rather
     than the second byte: since I'm catering to message consumers
     wrt pre-assuring sufficient message data, I might as well do it
     right
   - also fixed a bug in state ending routine
   - added fragmented message routines
   - hmmm, things are still broken for a partial and a complete message,
     since the server mungs the two together, resulting in two broken
     messages; I should have a garbage count, when more than maxbadmsg
     is received, the client is dropped
   - fixed bug with unexpected client disconnects
   - hmmm, better put a sleep in the routine: when a partial packet is
     received, the server will spend up to maxmsgwait seconds tightlooping,
     but I don't want to torch responsiveness for just one client

  July 27, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - Added define for TAIL
   - Added SO_REUSEADDR on socket

  July 28, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - Changed names so they are always set to something
   - Added tests for null-name resets
   - Created ReadShort()
   - Changed ReadInt(), ReadShort(), and ReadString() to check that
     there are sufficient bytes for their needs: clients are kicked if
     there is not; I think the server is fairly robust in this regard
   - Neatened up the reading routines
   - Completed tails on incoming messages
   - Added PackShort()
   - Completed tails on outgoing messages

  July 29, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - Added outgoing state message to join and id processing
   - fixed PackString() to pack null strings

  July 31, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - minor change to STATE message
   - completed outgoing state message for players and game state

  August 2, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added support routines for kicking players

  August 3, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added support for OPTIONS client message, and send out OPTIONSDENY
     at appropriate times
   - tweaked default options: farmers is off by default
   - woohoo, the Implementation document is now larger than the License
     document

  August 9, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added Start routines
   - added card shuffle, add, remove and check routines

  August 10, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - tweaked card routines
   - created hand structure
   - modified state message to include hole card, trump, and player pass state

  August 11, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added state send at end of start processing
   - added cards to state message
   - added next state computation: shaky, I'm sure, but present 

  August 12, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added game reset when all clients disconnect
   - added game end and and game end deny message support

  August 14, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin

  August 15, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - tweaked hand states to be 0 through 4 (can't pass negatives?)
   - changed farmers option to be screw the dealer
   - passing works for orders and calls
   - defending passes work
   - tweaked NextPlay()
   - added PickLeader()
   - removed cangoalone as an option
   - forced go alone if order partner and option set
   - added play processing, as well as invalid card detection

  August 16, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - fixed up card following routines
   - wrote card evaluation routine

  August 17, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added trick counters to hand structure and state message
   - added hand and game completion code
   - partial testing of hand completion

  August 18, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added card dropping
   - added trump calling
   - fixed bug computing previous player with (current-1)%
   - fixed bug computing next player
   - fixed bugs with hand and game completion
   - I played my first full game!

  August 19, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added trickover, handover and gameover messages
   - reset game after a win
   - added hand folding logic

  August 21, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added card sorting
   - fixed bug with defend offers
   - changed chat message header for server
   - bumped version to 0.8, preparatory to public alpha testing

version 0.8

  August 26, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added playoffer, defendoffer, calloffer, orderoffer, dropoffer
     and deal messages: all intended to initiate local client animations,
     not critical for game play

Version 0.9
