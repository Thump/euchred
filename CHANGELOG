    Support for minimal global variable
    
     - the minimal global variable is set when we want to reduce the protocol
       overhead at the possible expense of making some server actions unclear
       from the client perspective; specifically, we only tell targets about
       offers, and never send chat messages; I was hoping this would increase
       the hands/s measure of the client, but it only had a limited benefit:
       sad face
     - if minimal is set, don't send chat messages
     - only send offers to their target

    Several protocol cleanups
    
     - call SendState() once we've cleared the current cards after a trick is over
     - separated out the SendPlayOffer() from the clearing of the cards
     - call SendState() once tricks have been updated: this is needed for the
       client to calculate trick deltas correctly
     - removed extra SendState() in EvaluateCards()
     - some comment updates

    Removed this file: it used to build perl files from C code, but since I removed the perl client, it's not needed any more

    Client is working consistently, so tidying up the code
    
     - added a SendState() before SendHandOver(): without this, clients didn't
       have enough information to determine the post-hand state when the
       HANDOVER message was received
     - removed some code cruft in GameOver()
     - removed some extra logs
     - added team information to some existing logs
     - some tidying up of perl related files
     - added files for gitignore

    Complete game can now be played, yay!
    
     - various additions to logging, to see what's going on inside
     - improvements to various comments, as usual
     - added SendState() at various points: sometimes we weren't pushing
       updated state information to the clients before we sent them an event
       they were expected to act on
     - some more tab -> space changes *sigh*
     - fixed bug where were sending a play offer to the winner of a hand before
       the new hand was dealt: this was acceptable for manual clients, when the
       lag was long enough that the client had the new cards before acting, but
       not for the automated client, since it was triggering a new play with
       no cards to play from
     - we now only send play offers to the targeted player: this was to reduce
       log chatty-ness, but also reduces network and server load; I'll likely
       make a similar change to other offers as well
     - added CardName() function, which takes a card and returns a string name
       for it; then changed PrintCard() to use the new CardName() function

    Bug fixes found from developing the peuchre client
    
     - added new SendState() commands, to make sure the client has up to date
       information to act on for DEAL, PLAY, etc messages
     - after we get a bad play, re-send the play offer, to prompt the client
       to act again
     - send play offers in cases where we weren't before, makes it easier to
       code clients to respond, rather than having them monitor the state
     - reformatted some comments
