General ------------------------------------------------------------------- 

  This is Peuchrec, a command line client for the euchres euchre server.
  It is written in Perl.  It is pronounced Puker-C.  If you don't like
  it, write your own damn client: see ../euchres/Implementation to find
  out how.

  The purpose of this client is as an initial, test client, so there is
  no long term caching of player name or anything.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compiling ----------------------------------------------------------------- 

  The client is written in standard perl: the only Perl 5-isms are in
  the terminal stuff.  (See the BEGIN routine in config.pl.)

  The client needs access to ../common/message.h, so moving it out of
  the euchre-*/peuchrec directory would take some munging.
