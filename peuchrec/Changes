Perl Euchre Client Changes File

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

version 0.1

  May 10, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - started perl euchre client
   - added Usage() function
   - added switch processing (-h, -p:, -s:)

  May 11, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added socket connection routine
   - added message reader

  May 13, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - reorganized code
   - the main loop now accepts uncooked input, and runs a tight
     select() loop on both S and STDIN, although it is only processing
     STDIN commands

  May 15, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - redid raw input, first using the Term::ReadKey package, then using
     just the POSIX termios stuff; the ReadKey stuff is tidier, but the
     termios code will be there by default, which is a key feature
   - finished the screen code: some hairiness, but it looks cool
   - added some more global variables for cards and players
   - added some message routines, to manage the list of displayed messages
   - I'll have to mung around to get key presses to work, be nice to do
     it generically
   - unbuffered stdout, so the last line will print

  May 16, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - message formatting is completed: AddMessage() and watch the magic
   - woohoo, message scrolling works!
   - redirected all log messages through AddMessage
   - next: add server loss code

  Denis McLaughlin
   - Prepared initial code to send JOIN request and protocol version

  May 19, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - reorganized code
   - sending JOIN request
   - problems receiving JOIN acknowledge?

  May 21, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - removed ConfigChat routine with a require "messages.pl" call, to
     avoid potential conflicts with sysread() and select()
   - fixed select() problem, now receiving events, but looping?

  May 27, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - tweaked the byte read section: I'm going to have to be aware of
     byte ordering issues to keep things portable
   - client receives JOINACCEPT, not processing yet
   - added perltags script, and a makefile for it

  May 31, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added a server die routine
   - added a proper JOINACCEPT routine

  June 1, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - checked that multiple clients on a single server work
   - cleaned up screen
   - added a screen prompting routine
   - added a prompt to allow port number to be changed
   - up arrows broken?

  June 5, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - all bytes being sent are munged for byte order
   - client can now understand JOINDENYs
   - client can now understand SERVERQUITs
   - client now sends CLIENTQUIT on exit

  June 6, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - we now properly service DECLINEs, although when the server closes
     socket, it looks like a server disconnect to us
   - renamed OpenServer() to Connect(), and made a Disconnect(): on server
     quits or declines or join refusals, the client does not exit
   - we now clean $cmd between bad commands
   - arrow keys work again
   - name and server setting is now supported
   - messaging clean up
   - client can handle the KICK message
   - woo hoo, chat window shows ^^^^ when the screen is scroll backed, just
     like quake!

  June 12, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added an ID message, sent after connect, and after name change
   - client can now send a chat message
   - client can now receive a chat message
   - increasing hairiness, the prompt code now allows backspacing

  June 15, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - all protocol strings will no be immediately preceded by their length,
     and may not be null terminated
   - rewrite ID message in light of this
   - oops, my mistake, it already conformed

  June 27, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - reformatted the JOIN message to include the user's name
   - fixed timing problem with SendJoin and SendID
   - added command interlocking, preventing multiple connects, disconnects
     prior to connections, etc

  June 29, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - changed all messages to be preceded by total message length
   - changed order from <gh> <ph> <msglen> to <msglen> <gh> <ph>
   - fixed bug in ID message

  July 6, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - switched messages to have the msglen first rather than second, makes
     it easier for protocol checking
   - fixed bug with SERVERQUIT
   - hmmm, problem with server KICK messages?

  July 27, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - Added $tail
   - Added SO_REUSEADDR to socket stuff

  July 28, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - Added tails to outgoing messages
   - Added tail expectation on incoming messages: nothing happens if it's
     not there, but a message is posted

  July 29, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - began adding state parse routine
   - redid player structure
   - cleaned up some keyboard stuff: $raw appears to be magic, and I
     don't care to investigate why
   - replaced the ugly sysread()s with ReadInt(), ReadString() and ReadShort()

  July 31, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added ReadBoolean()
   - redid screen to dynamically track partner and opponents
   - completed player and game status reading
   - added ^L as a valid command
   - still problem with multiple players and updates

  August 1, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added a SetTeams() function, to properly apportion teams

  August 2, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added state sensitive help menus, and propagate limitations to service
     routine
   - added routines to enable player kicking
   - added multiple user names: makes it easier to debug multi user
     problems without having to manually reset names: hi everyone!

  August 3, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - changed the PeuchreC title screen
   - added makefile entry for updating the messages.pl file
   - added routines to get and send options
   - Fixed the problem with being booted from the server: if the server
     sends us a kick message, and then immediately severs the link, the
     next client sysread() will sometimes return ENOLINK (ie. an undefined
     return value, with $! set to 67) prior to returning any of the data
     available on the socket, even though the data was sent prior to
     severance.  I've worked around this by just redoing the sysread()
     if we receive an undefined return from sysread().  If we get more
     than one system error, we're hooped.
   - cleaned up the disconnect message, and ignored SIGPIPE (we handle
     asynchronous server disconnects via select(), so we don't care
     about SIGPIPE
   - added options list to screen display: adof, meaning cangoalone,
     candefend, aloneonorder, and farmers hand, - means not enabled
   - added OPTIONSDENY handling

  August 9, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin

   - added game status display

  August 12, 1999
  Denis McLaughlin
   - added hole card printing
   - simplified and corrected the SetTeams() function: teams are now assigned
     consistently and intelligently
   - added game end command, and associated support
   - added ^d as an exit command

   - reformatted screen: moved options to upper right
   - added SendChoice() and SendOrder() routine
   - swapped variable names: holeoffer to orderoffer, trumpoffer to calloffer

  Denis McLaughlin
   - fixed erroneous trump display between hands
   - fixed bad trump string formatting
   - added playoffer, defendoffer, calloffer, orderoffer, dropoffer
     and deal messages: all intended to initiate local client animations,
     not critical for game play
   - changed "aloneonorder" option back to a
   - changed prompt string: when you have the option to order your partner,
     and aloneonorder is set, then you are only offered the choice to
     pass or order alone
