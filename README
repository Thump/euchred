General

  This is a software package for playing euchre: it currently contains
  a server (euchred) written in C.  It used to also contain a text mode
  perl client, but that's been moved to a different github repo.

  This package is currently in alpha testing, so expect things to break.
  However, with some luck it can be used to play a complete game of
  euchre.

  The package is copyrighted by me, Denis McLaughlin, and licensed under
  the GNU Public License.  God bless Richard Stallman.

Requirements

  Server
    This package has been written on Linux, and it runs pretty ok there.
    It should be easy to compile euchred on any Unix system, so long as
    the GNU tools or some equivalent is available.  It doesn't use a
    priviledged port by default, so normal users can compile and run it.

  Client
    The client will need a working Perl 5 install on a Unix system.  The
    client depends on various terminal escape codes (screen clearing and
    text highlighting) which have been tested on the linux console as
    well as an xterm.  Other terminal types may need some tweaking.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Making It

  Just type in make from the top level directory (the one containing
  this file): this should compile the server, leaving the resulting
  executable in the src/ subdirectory.  If something falls off
  during the compile then, uhm, try and fix it.  Or at least let me know
  what happened by sending me mail.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installing It

  We're still in alpha testing, so there is no installer yet.  The
  server assumes it will be run from its src/ directory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running It

  To run the server:
    - cd src/
    - ./euchred
  The defaults have verbose logging turned on, so you'll see heaps of
  log messages.
