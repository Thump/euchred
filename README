General

  This is a software package for playing euchre: it currently contains
  a server (euchres) written in C, and a text-mode client (peuchrec)
  written in Perl.

  This package is currently in alpha testing, so expect things to break.
  However, with some luck it can be used to play a complete game of
  euchre.

  The package is copyrighted by me, Denis McLaughlin, and licensed under
  the GNU Public License.  God bless Richard Stallman.

Requirements

  Server
    This package has been written on Linux, and it runs pretty ok there.
    It should be easy to compile euchres on any Unix system, so long as
    the GNU tools or some equivalent is available.  It doesn't use a
    priviledged port by default, so normal users can compile and run it.

  Client
    The client will need a working Perl 5 install on a Unix system.  The
    client depends on various terminal escape codes (screen clearing and
    text highlighting) which have been tested on the linux console as
    well as an xterm.  Other terminal types may need some tweaking.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Making It

  Just type in make from the top level directory (the one containing
  this file): this should compile the server, leaving the resulting
  executable in the euchres/ subdirectory.  If something falls off
  during the compile then, uhm, try and fix it.  Or at least let me know
  what happened by sending me mail.

  Currently the only client is written in Perl, and so doesn't need
  to be compiled.  You'll find the peuchrec client executable in the
  peuchrec directory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installing It

  We're still in alpha testing, so there is no installer yet.  The
  client and server both assume they will be run from their respecting
  peuchrec/ and euchres/ directories.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running It

  In one screen:
    - cd euchres/
    - ./euchres
  The defaults have verbose logging turned on, so you'll see heaps of
  log messages.
  
  In another screen
    - cd peuchrec
    - ./peuchrec

  Peuchrec is single player client, so to actually have a game of euchre
  you'll either have to run four clients and try not to cheat, or find
  three friends who also have the client.

  If you're running the clients and server on the same system, the
  client's default server setting is fine.  Otherwise reset the server
  by running ./peuchrec -s <servername>, or using the 's' command in the
  client to reset the server name.

  Once you've started the client, there is a state-sensitive help menu.
  In brief, 'c' to connect, and once four players have joined (you'll
  see them in the display), 's' to start the game.  Up and down arrows
  scroll the chat messages forward and backward (space to zip to the
  bottom), left and right arrow highlight options (when available),
  return selects the current highlighted option.
